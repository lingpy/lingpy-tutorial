    "# Sequence Comparison with LingPy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will run you through the major steps needed in order to infer cognates automatically with [LingPy](http://lingpy.org) ([List and Forkel 2017](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2017i)) from linguistic word list data and to export the data into various formats so that you can either inspect them using tools like the [EDICTOR](http://edictor.digling.org) ([List 2017](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2017d)), or further analyse them, using software like [SplitsTree](http://splitstree.org) ([Huson 1998](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Huson1998)) or [BEAST](http://www.beast2.org) ([Bouckaert et al. 2014](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Bouckaert2014)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this tutorial assumes that you have at least an undergraduate level understanding of historical linguistics (particularly the basic methods used in historical language comparison, often summarized under the label \"comparative method\"), requiring only working knowledge of Python and command line operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is required that you have installed both LingPy in the version [2.6](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy/releases/tag/v2.6) for Python3 (as this tutorial will assume that you use Python3) available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy), and (as a plus) the [python-igraph](http://igraph.org) package ([Csárdi and Nepusz 2006](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Csardi2006)). Furthermore, in order to follow all examples given in this tutorial, it is useful to work with the [Ipython](http://ipython.org) suite, which is very convenient for testing code pieces directly against the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into different blocks, during which different aspects of sequence comparison will be illustrated from the concrete perspective of LingPy. In order to understand fully all that is going on, however, this tutorial won't be sufficient, and it is recommended that those who are interested in the algorithmic and conceptual details of LingPy's major algorithms for sequence comparison have a closer look at the book [Sequence Comparison in Historical Linguistics](https://sequencecomparison.github.io) ([List 2014](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2014d)) in which the most comprehensive state of the art is reflected. More recent papers might occasionally be mentioned in order to account for those aspects of sequence comparison which have been changed since then, but the book on sequence comparison (which is also freely available for download) is still the best starting point.\n",

    "2. Phonetic Alignment\n",
    "3. Automatic Cognate Detection\n",

But in order to give the algorithms a fair chance to interpret the data in the same way in which they would be interpreted by linguists, a general practice for phonetic transcriptions is indispensable. \n",

This dataset was intensively verified and revised according to primary source data from widely accepted published works (dictionaries and online databases) and first-hand knowledge of a Polynesian linguist. Revisions included: correcting invalid entries, reordering misplaced segments, adding missing segments, modifying ambiguous transcription conventions, and deleting semantically distant forms for concepts with multiple entries. The dataset was additionally cleaned by converting the various original transcriptions into a valid version of IPA accepted by LingPy (for details, see 2.4 below). The testset is located in the same folder in which you also find this interactive tutorial, which we provide in various formats. In the following, we will assume that you opened the terminal in this folder (or ``cd``ed into this folder after opening your terminal). \n"

    "1. contrary to most linguists' intuition, the columns do **not** indicate languages: each row indicates one word and, as a result, language names need to be redundantly repeated\n",

    "3. in order to increase readability, column headers are upper-case when LingPy writes them to file, but this is not required (internally all columns are represented as lowercase when loaded into LingPy's objects)\n",
    "4. depending on the names of the columns, values will be interpreted by default: if you have a column called `cogid`, this will be converted to an integer, and `tokens` usually assumes that you have a string separated by spaces.

To check how columns are interpreted, you can check the file [wordlist.rc](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy/blob/master/lingpy/data/conf/wordlist.rc) where you will find a full account of currently supported values.\n",

    "Not all of the columns in the table above are fully \"standardized\". The `DOCULECT` one, for example, so far only requires that distinct languages are given distinct names, no matter what those names contain (as long it has no tabulation stops). But for the purpose of exporting the data to other formats afterward, it is useful to restrict to alphanumeric names here, and to exclude all brackets or spaces from the language names, as we have been doing in this test set. This becomes especially important when inferring trees or using trees in further LingPy analyses: as trees are represented in the [Newick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) format, where brackets play an important role, brackets in the names for the doculects will confuse the algorithm and raise an error.\n",

As the linguistic sign has three major dimensions, the *language*, the *meaning*, and the *word form*, `GLOTTOCODE`, the language identifier provided by the [Glottolog project](http://glottolog.org) ([Hammarström, Forkel and Haspelmath 2017](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Hammarstroem2017)) and `CONCEPTICON_ID`, the meaning identifier provided by the [Concepticon project](http://concepticon.clld.org) ([List, Cysouw, and Forkel 2016](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2016a)) cover two of these aspects, while the third aspect, the consistency of the form, is currently covered by LingPy (more on this below)."

    "* `Alignments`: Class allows to align all cognate sets in a word list. Requires one column which stores the cognate sets as well as a column for `doculect`, `concept`, and transcription (default: `ipa`) or user-defined *segmented transcription* (default: `tokens`). Alignments can be carried out in different ways, the algorithms follow the ones first described in [List (2012a)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2012b).\n",
    "* `LexStat`: Core class for automatic cognate detection, following the algorithm first described in [List (2012b)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2012a) and later expanded in [List (2014)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2014d), and [List, Greenhill, and Gray (2017)](List2017c). \n",
    "* `Partial`: Recent algorithm proposed in [List, Lopez, and Bapteste (2016)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2016g), allows -- provided data is morpheme-segmented -- to search for partial cognates in the data.\n",

    "### 2.4 Segmentation of Phonetic Entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting transcription conventions into IPA is critical for ensuring that the dataset can be properly analysed. In the original Polynesian dataset, for example, multiple inconsistent conventions were discovered. These included outdated, pre-IPA, conventions; regional orthographic conventions; and individual linguist inventions. These resulted in highly ambiguous representations that could easily lead to incorrect interpretations of the data: characters associated with a given sound used to represent an entirely different sound (*h* used for glottal stop; *y* used for *θʸ*); one character used to represent various sound segments (*g* used for velar nasal, voiced velar stop, and voiced uvular stop); one set of characters used to represent multiple series of sound segments (two adjacent vowels used for adjacent like vowels, vowel-glottal stop-vowel, and long vowels); double characters used to indicate one segment (*ng* used for velar nasal; *nC* used for prenasalised consonants; *hC* or *Ch* used for aspirated consonants); diacritical marking on vowels used to indicate length (*v̄* used for long vowels); and diacritical marking on or between vowels to indicate glottal stops (*v̀* used for glottal stop-vowel; *v'v* used for vowel-glottal stop-vowel). Linguists applying methods for automatic cognate detection should always keep in mind that our data is usually rather sparse and therefore not robust enough to cope with these problems alone. As a result from our experience in working with the Polynesian data sample, we therefore advise all users of LingPy to make sure that their data is properly segmented. In the following we will provide some basic information, how this can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"normal\" requirement of the data to be written in IPA, LingPy can use the explicit segmentation of the data into sound segments as it was provided by the user. Segmentation is represented as a space-separated string in the input data, as you can see when looking at the table above, right in the cells of the `TOKENS` column. While segmentation looks unspectacular in these cases where each sound is represented by only one symbol, it may become problematic when dealing with affricates, pre-aspirated sounds, and complex vowels. The problem is usually that IPA transcriptions are inherently ambiguous, and this ambiguity is then passed on to the algorithms which cannot handle it. For example, a word like German `[`apfəl`]` \"apple\" could be either segmented as `[` a p f ə l `]`, or, and historically more consistently, as `[` a pf ə l `]`. But if the latter reading is intended (and this is usually language-family-specific), the only way to handle this consistently in IPA would be to put the bar over it: `[`ap͡fəl`]`. This practice, however, would still render the detection of pre-aspiration and other cases impossible. Although LingPy deals rather well with explicit IPA, we recommend all users to segment the data themselves and indicate this by placing one column in their input word list, in which the phonetic entries are explicitly segmented by a space (with the underscore being used to mark original spaces, i.e., word breaks).\n",
    "\n",
    "LingPy's `sequence`-package offers many functions to handle phonetic sequences and to segment them automatically. As an example, consider the following code-pieces and try to find out what they are actually doing:"

    "You can see from these examples that LingPy's `ipa2tokens` function automatically identifies diacritics and the like, but that you can also tweak it to some extent. If the sequence contains white spaces, as in the first example, `ipa2tokens` will split by white space and assume that the data is *already* segmented. We won't go into the details of this and other functions here, but you should consider giving the documentation a proper read before you start spending time on segmenting your data manually. At the same time, when trusting LingPy's default algorithm for segmentation, you should always make sure after using it that the segmentations make sense. If they are largely wrong or problematic, you should refine them before running any automatic cognate detection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to use the `segments` package by Steven Moran, whose main idea is more comprehensively described in [Moran and Cysouw (2017)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Moran2017).

    "### 2.5 Checking Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "For cognate detection, it is not only important to have good phonetic transcriptions (ideally segmented in such a form that they were checked by an experienced linguist), but also to make sure that there are **enough words** in your data. If the data is too sparse, even human linguists would not be able to find any signal based on regular sound correspondences, provided they see the languages the first time and don't know their history (which is the situation for every algorithm). Following an earlier study by [List (2014b)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2014c), we know now that at least 100 word pairs for languages as disparate as English and French are needed to provide a solid basis for automatic cognate detection. But when dealing with a large dataset of different languages, which necessarily contains a number of gaps (not all concepts can be elicited in the sources, field work has not provided enough details, etc.), it can be deleterious if the *mutual coverage* between the languages is low. \n",
    "\n",
    "By mutual coverage, I mean the number of comparable word pairs (with the same concept) for each language pair in a given dataset. We can compare different aspects of mutual coverage, such as the *average mutual coverage*, where we average the number of available word pairs, or the *minimal mutual coverage*, which provides the smallest mutual coverage of any pair of languages. In addition, one can also ask for the subset fulfilling a minimal mutual coverage for all language pairs, and this task would return the subset of languages in a `Wordlist` which all have at least the mutual coverage specified by the user. LingPy offers now (in version 2.5.1) solutions for all these problems, but since the last problem is considerably hard and computationally intensive, we won't discuss it here, but will instead simply check the minimal mutual coverage which holds for all languages in our sample. So we try to find the lower bound of concept pairs which all languages have in common (type ```$ python3 autocogs.py coverage1``` in command line)."

If the score is high, this means that the sounds are judged to be likely to be related, if it is below 0 (that is, if it has a negative score) this means that it is assumed that a relationship is unlikely. Scoring functions in LingPy are usually stored in so-called sound-class models. We will introduce sound classes in detail in the next section, so here it should be enough to mention that our scorers are not defined for pure IPA segments, but rather for subsets,  which make it more convenient to define scores for dissimilarities. Instead of comparing `[`tʰ`]` with `[`tʃ`]`, we internally compare ```T``` with ```C```, which is faster to compute, but also easier to define. In the following, we will work with the SCA-scorer, a scorer for the scoring function underlying the SCA algorithm ([List 2014](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2014d)).

    "\n",
    "Above, I wrote that LingPy takes care of the *word form* as one of the units of the linguistic sign in the classical \"Saussurean\" model. But how can we know whether LingPy recognizes a symbol or not? For this, we need to understand what LingPy does internally with word forms. Here, LingPy follows [Dolgopolsky's (1964)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Dolgopolsky1964) idea of \"sound classes\", namely the idea that we can break down the complexity inherent in phonetic transcription to some major classes of sounds so that those sounds represent some kind of a coherent unit. Dolgopolsky was thinking of sounds which often occur in correspondence relation to each other, assuming that there is a certain sound-correspondence probability inherent in all sounds (see also [Brown, Holman, and Wichmann 2013](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Brown2013)). In my experience so far, this is definitely one important aspect, but even more important is the role of reducing variation which is unnecessary for historical comparison while at the same time maintaining a sufficient degree of distinctiveness. For this reason, I expanded Dolgopolsky's original system of only 10 sound classes to as many as 25 sound classes, and LingPy further offers the alphabet which was used for the [ASJP project](http://asjp.org) ([Wichmann, Holman, and Brown 2014](Wichmann2014)), which consists of 40 symbols in a slightly modified version. The following image illustrates the differences between these sound class alphabets and also shows how they represent the Greek word for \"daughter\".\n",

    "![image](img/soundclasses.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we represent sound classes in LingPy? There is one main function that converts a segmented sound sequence into sound classes. This function `tokens2class` takes as input a list or a tuple of segments, that is, the output which you would also get when calling `ipa2tokens`, and a valid sound class model. You can theoretically create models yourself, and pass them as an instance of a specific `Model` class in LingPy, but for the moment, we will only use the ones which are there and denote them with strings, i.e., `dolgo` for Dolgopolsky's model, `sca` for my expanded model of Dolgopolsky, and `asjp` for the ASJP model). Let's just take these three and another specific model, called `art` (for \"articulation\") which gives numbers to indicate the prosody of sounds, and convert the word Greek `[`θiɣatɛra`]` into the different sound class systems (you can also trigger this by typing ```$ python3 autocogs.py classes``` in the command line).\n",

    "\n",
    "Phonetic alignment is *per se* independent of the existence of any word list data. Instead, it is a way to align phonetic sequences (words in phonetic transcription) in various ways. Phonetic alignment is an important pre-requisite in order to identify regular sound correspondences. Regular sound correspondences again are important to identify cognates (at least in the classical framework of the comparative method). In addition, alignment analyses are useful in presenting one's analyses in a transparent way, since, unfortunately, scholar often think that their cognate judgments are self-evident, ignoring that a linguist with another language family as their specialty will barely be able to follow the idiosyncratic discourse on language-family-specific sound change patterns and the like. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to carry out alignment analyses in LingPy, you have a range of different possibilities, and there won't be the time to cover all of them here. Instead, I will illustrate how you can make a quick multiple alignment using the ```Multiple``` class of LingPy. This class is automatically imported when importing LingPy, and it requires a list of sequences as input. Here again, LingPy will automatically try to split your input sequences if they are not already segmentized, but we advise you to segmentize them properly before. We use four words for \"dog\" in Polynesian languages (Samoan, Hawaiian, North Marquesan, and Anuta). We do not type them in by pre-segmenting them, but rather tell LingPy to treat vowels not as dipthongs. We start with the simplest method, the *progressive alignment*, which first makes a little tree of the input sequences and then aligns them by going the tree from the leaves to the root, every time aligning two more until all are aligned:"

For this, we even do not need to re-write the data, we just add another row where we change the content, give it a random name (we call it \"tokens\", as this also signals LingPy that the input should be treated as a sequence and not as a string), and specify this for the `LexStat` instance method as the column in the file where the `segments` are.

These algorithms are all contained in the `LexStat` class which often confuses users, as one of the algorithms provided by `LexStat` is also called `lexstat`. Internally, however, it makes sense, as all algorithms were created at the same time, when the LexStat algorithm was published ([List 2012b](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2012a)), so it was written into one class which was called \"LexStat\".\n",

    "\n",
    "1. consonant-class-matching (CCM), following Dolgopolky's (1964) early idea to assume that words with two matching consonant classes would likely be cognate,\n",
    "2. phenotypic sequence similarity partitioning (PSSP), follows the general idea also applied in homology detection in biology, by which sequences are clustered into sets of homologs based on a partitioning algorithm which is applied to a distance or a similarity matrix representing the overall sequence similarity,\n",
    "3. language-specific sequence similarity partitioning (LSSP), follows the core idea of the LexStat algorithm by which sequence similarity is calculated on a language-specific basis for each language pair in the data, based on permutation statistics which give hints regarding the most likely candidates for regular sound correspondences.\n"

    "### 4.4 Aligning the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "One great advantage of LingPy is that alignments can also be directly computed from automatically inferred cognate sets. This is useful, first also for manually annotated cognate sets, as it saves a lot of work, since alignment algorithms come very close to human judgments, and it requires only minimal post-annotation by humans to correct the errors. Second, it is useful to check the data, as it makes transparent where the algorithm found the similarity that triggered a respective cognate decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "When carrying out alignment analyses, we use the `Alignments` class in LingPy which requires a word list as input as well as the column which contains the cognate sets which shall be aligned. We will use the \"infomap\" analysis for our automatic alignments, since this usually performs better than the other methods. This is done by specifying the keyword `ref` as \"infomap\" when calling the `Alignments` class. As a further important tweak, we first load the data into the `LexStat` class so that we have the inferred sound correspondences which will then be used to compute our alignments. For this purpose, we load the file `mikronesian.bin.tsv` which stores the results of our permutation analysis and provides language-specific scores for all segments in the data (high scores indicating likely sound correspondences, low scores < 0 indicating non-corresponding sounds). We align using the normal progressive alignment, which is usually sufficient for smaller alignments and is slightly faster. When calling the alignment algorithm, we define the specific keyword `scoredict` and pass it the `lex.cscorer`, which stores the language-specific scoring functions for our data:"

    "\n",
    "LingPy has a couple of evaluation methods implemented, and since we have original expert cognate judgments from ABVD, we can compare our findings against theirs. Comparing cognate set accuracy is not necessarily a trivial problem, as we deal with cluster comparisons, which is a topic that was debated a lot in circles outside of linguistics, and it would lead us too far away if we discussed it in detail here now. For a linguistic viewpoint with a brief working example of our preferred method, the B-Cubed scores (see [Hauer and Kondrak 2011](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Hauer2011), [Bagga and Baldwin 1998](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Bagga1998), and [Amigo et al. 2009](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Amigo2009)), see List, Greenhill, and Gray (2017). What you need to know, however, is that evaluation in NLP circles usually comes along with the concepts of *precision*, *recall*, and *f-score*. Initially, I found them rather difficult to grasp, as historical linguists usually think in terms of false positives and false negatives. In order to understand the idea, one should think that an algorithm for cognate detection can basically do two things either right or wrong: it could cluster words which are not cognate, or it could fail to cluster words as cognate. In the first case, we would measure this in terms of precision, by counting, how often the algorithm proposes correct or incorrect answers, and in the latter case, we measure the proportion of cognate sets which are missed. In the B-Cubed measure we use, this translates roughly to a measure of false/true positives vs. false/true negatives, but it is not entirely the same. The f-score computes the harmonic mean, which summarizes both values, and we usually want to improve the f-score and we use it to compare different algorithms with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start and do this comparison now, by loading the respective functions from the LingPy evaluation module, and computing precision, recall, and f-scores for all our different automatically inferred cognate sets with respect to the gold standard. The gold standard is located in the column `COGID` of the input file, so we need to name this when comparing with any of the other columns (like `LEXSTATID`, etc., ```$ python3 autocogs.py evaluate``` in terminal)."

    "The Cross-Linguistic Data Formats initiative ([Forkel et al. 2017](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Forkel2017a)) provides standardized formats for the sharing of data amenable for cross-linguistic comparison. LingPy now also offers the possibility to export to CLDF as well as to read CLDF files. Since CLDF is more explicit and powerful than LingPy's file-formats, you can add additional data, like your sources in form of BibTex files. We have prepared a BibTex file along with this tutorial and pass it to the algorith, so that it becomes included into the CLDF-package:"
